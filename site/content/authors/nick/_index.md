I have been extremely lucky to work in many different realms, including as a Journalist at the New York Times, data scientist at the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab and Dealer.com in Vermont, and “data artist in residence” at startup Conduce in California.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in biostatistics at Vanderbilt University. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Vermont where I majored in mathematics and statistics and minored in computer science.

My research focuses on unsupervized and semi-supervized methods for exploring large omics datasets, with a heavy focus on visualization.

I like data. Manipulating it, modeling it, making it (simulation), visualizing it and yes, even cleaning it. I do these things with some combination of R, Python, and Javascript (d3.js in particular). Most recently I have been fascinated with conveying complex statistical topics and methods using intuitive and interactive graphics.
